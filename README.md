This Python-based project simulates a slot machine, offering an interactive command-line interface where users can deposit funds, choose the number of lines to bet on, place bets, and spin to win. It's designed to mimic the basic functionalities of a real slot machine, including betting mechanisms, symbol odds, and payout calculations.

## Features

- **User Deposits**: Users can start by depositing any amount of money they wish to play with.
- **Customizable Betting**: Choose to bet on 1, 2, or 3 lines of the slot machine, offering strategic flexibility.
- **Dynamic Symbol Odds**: Features four symbols (A, B, C, D) with different frequencies and values, influencing the game's odds and payouts.
- **Winning Mechanism**: Wins are determined by matching symbols across the bet lines. A winning line multiplies the user's bet by the value of the matched symbol, adding to their balance.
- **Continuous Play**: Users can continue to play until they decide to quit or run out of money.
- **Simple CLI Gameplay**: Accessible via the command line interface, making it easy to start and play without a graphical interface.

## System Requirements

- **Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system to run the game.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Navigate to the directory containing the script and run it.
2. **Deposit Funds**: Input the amount of money you'd like to deposit into the slot machine.
3. **Select Lines**: Choose the number of lines to bet on. Options include 1, 2, or 3 lines.
4. **Place Your Bet**: Specify your bet amount for each selected line, adhering to the minimum and maximum bet limits.
5. **Spin and Win**: The slot machine spins, randomly selecting symbols for each column. Wins are determined if symbols align across your bet lines.
6. **Repeat or Quit**: Continue playing by spinning again or quit the game by entering the designated quit command.

## Winning Calculation

- Each symbol (A, B, C, D) has an associated value. Matching symbols across a bet line multiplies your bet by the symbol's value.
- Symbol A: Value 5
- Symbol B: Value 4
- Symbol C: Value 3
- Symbol D: Value 2
